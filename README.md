# What are Agents?
Agents are AI programs that execute tasks autonomously. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses. Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, agents dynamically adapt their approach based on context, knowledge and tool results.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

**Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).

**Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.

**Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.

**Level 3**: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.
